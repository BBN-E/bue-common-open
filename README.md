bue-common-open
===============

The BBN Speech, Language, and Multimedia Group uses an internal Java library of common
utility functions, `bue-common`.  We sometimes make releases of open-source 
software which depends on parts of this library, requiring that certain classes
by open-sourced as well.  This repository contains the (small) open-source 
portion of this library.

While anyone is welcome to use this code, in general no support is provided.
