`nlp-core-open` is useful if you would like to:
* score coreference using B^3, BLANC, MUC, or CEAF (`com.bbn.nlp.coreference.measures`)
* load LDC's ERE event annotation (`com.bbn.nlp.corpora.ere`)
* read and write the format used for TAC Entity Detection and Linking evaluations (`com.bbn.nlp.edl`)
